# Bytefrog Clients

This repository contains two sample Bytefrog clients - one command line interface and one with a UI implemented with JavaFX. These clients allow an instance of the Bytefrog agent to connect, and handle the incoming trace data.

These clients are no longer being developed or maintained, and are released as examples of Bytefrog.
